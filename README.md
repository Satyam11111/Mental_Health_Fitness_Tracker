### **Mental Health Fitness Tracker Project in Machine Learning**

#### **Objective**
The objective of this project is to build a machine learning model that predicts or evaluates an individual's mental health status based on various factors such as sleep patterns, work-life balance, physical activity, and stress levels. Additionally, the project can provide insights and recommendations to improve mental well-being.

---

#### **Dataset Used**
Datasets for mental health analysis are often available on platforms like Kaggle, UCI, or other repositories. Some examples include:
- **Mental Health in Tech Survey Dataset** (Kaggle)
- **Workplace Stress Survey Data**
- Custom-created datasets through user surveys (e.g., Google Forms).

##### **Dataset Features**
A typical dataset for a mental health tracker may include:
1. **Age:** Age of the individual.
2. **Gender:** Gender of the individual.
3. **Sleep Hours:** Average hours of sleep per day.
4. **Physical Activity:** Daily physical activity in hours or as a categorical value (e.g., None, Moderate, High).
5. **Stress Level:** Self-reported stress level on a scale (e.g., 1-10).
6. **Work Hours:** Number of work hours per day.
7. **Social Interaction:** Frequency of social interactions (categorical or numerical).
8. **Mental Health Issue History:** Yes/No for any known history of mental health issues.
9. **Target Variable:** Overall mental health score or category (e.g., Good, Moderate, Poor).

#### **Steps in the Project**

1. **Importing Libraries and Dataset**
   - Use Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn for analysis and visualization.
   - Use Scikit-learn for machine learning.
   - For time-series data (if applicable), use libraries like `statsmodels` or `fbprophet`.

   ```python
   import pandas as pd
   import numpy as np
   import seaborn as sns
   import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
   from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
   from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
   from sklearn.metrics import classification_report, accuracy_score

   # Load dataset
   data = pd.read_csv('mental_health_data.csv')
   ```

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Check for missing values, outliers, and feature distributions.
   - Visualize correlations between features:
     ```python
     sns.pairplot(data)
     sns.heatmap(data.corr(), annot=True, cmap='coolwarm')
     ```

3. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Handle missing values using imputation methods.
   - Encode categorical variables such as `Gender` and `Mental Health Issue History`:
     ```python
     data = pd.get_dummies(data, columns=['Gender', 'Mental Health Issue History'], drop_first=True)
     ```
   - Normalize numerical features like `Sleep Hours`, `Physical Activity`, and `Stress Level`.

4. **Feature Selection**
   - Analyze the importance of features using correlation or feature importance methods (e.g., Random Forest Feature Importance):
     ```python
     from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
     model = RandomForestClassifier()
     model.fit(X_train, y_train)
     feature_importances = model.feature_importances_
     ```

5. **Model Selection and Training**
   - Choose appropriate models for prediction or classification:
     - Logistic Regression
     - Random Forest Classifier
     - Gradient Boosting (e.g., XGBoost, LightGBM)
   - Train the model:
     ```python
     from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
     model = RandomForestClassifier(random_state=42)
     model.fit(X_train, y_train)
     ```

6. **Model Evaluation**
   - Evaluate the model using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score:
     ```python
     y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
     print(classification_report(y_test, y_pred))
     print("Accuracy:", accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred))
     ```

7. **Insights and Recommendations**
   - Based on the predictions, provide actionable insights:
     - Individuals with low sleep hours and high stress levels should aim to improve sleep hygiene.
     - Suggest exercises or activities for those with low physical activity scores.
     - Recommend professional help for individuals with consistently poor mental health scores.

8. **Integration with a Tracker Application (Optional)**
   - Use Flask/Django to deploy the model as a web application.
   - Collect real-time data through user inputs or integrations with fitness trackers.
   - Provide dashboards with mental health trends and personalized recommendations.

#### **Key Insights**
- Stress levels, physical activity, and sleep hours are usually the most influential factors for mental health.
- A robust model can predict mental health status and enable targeted recommendations.
- Encouraging behavioral changes (e.g., better sleep, reduced work hours) can improve mental health outcomes.
