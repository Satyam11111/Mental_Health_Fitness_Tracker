### **Mental Health Fitness Tracker Project in Machine Learning**

#### **Objective**
The objective of this project is to build a machine learning model that predicts or evaluates an individual's mental health status based on various factors such as sleep patterns, work-life balance, physical activity, and stress levels. Additionally, the project can provide insights and recommendations to improve mental well-being.

---

#### **Dataset Used**
Datasets for mental health analysis are often available on platforms like Kaggle, UCI, or other repositories. Some examples include:
- **Mental Health in Tech Survey Dataset** (Kaggle)
- **Workplace Stress Survey Data**
- Custom-created datasets through user surveys (e.g., Google Forms).

##### **Dataset Features**
A typical dataset for a mental health tracker may include:
1. **Age:** Age of the individual.
2. **Gender:** Gender of the individual.
3. **Sleep Hours:** Average hours of sleep per day.
4. **Physical Activity:** Daily physical activity in hours or as a categorical value (e.g., None, Moderate, High).
5. **Stress Level:** Self-reported stress level on a scale (e.g., 1-10).
6. **Work Hours:** Number of work hours per day.
7. **Social Interaction:** Frequency of social interactions (categorical or numerical).
8. **Mental Health Issue History:** Yes/No for any known history of mental health issues.
9. **Target Variable:** Overall mental health score or category (e.g., Good, Moderate, Poor).

#### **Steps in the Project**

1. **Importing Libraries and Dataset**
   - Use Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn for analysis and visualization.
   - Use Scikit-learn for machine learning.
   - For time-series data (if applicable), use libraries like `statsmodels` or `fbprophet`.

   ```python
   import pandas as pd
   import numpy as np
   import seaborn as sns
   import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
   from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
   from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
   from sklearn.metrics import classification_report, accuracy_score

   # Load dataset
   data = pd.read_csv('mental_health_data.csv')
   ```

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Check for missing values, outliers, and feature distributions.
   - Visualize correlations between features:
     ```python
     sns.pairplot(data)
     sns.heatmap(data.corr(), annot=True, cmap='coolwarm')
     ```

3. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Handle missing values using imputation methods.
   - Encode categorical variables such as `Gender` and `Mental Health Issue History`:
     ```python
     data = pd.get_dummies(data, columns=['Gender', 'Mental Health Issue History'], drop_first=True)
     ```
   - Normalize numerical features like `Sleep Hours`, `Physical Activity`, and `Stress Level`.

4. **Feature Selection**
   - Analyze the importance of features using correlation or feature importance methods (e.g., Random Forest Feature Importance):
     ```python
     from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
     model = RandomForestClassifier()
     model.fit(X_train, y_train)
     feature_importances = model.feature_importances_
     ```

5. **Model Selection and Training**
   - Choose appropriate models for prediction or classification:
     - Logistic Regression
     - Random Forest Classifier
     - Gradient Boosting (e.g., XGBoost, LightGBM)
   - Train the model:
     ```python
     from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
     model = RandomForestClassifier(random_state=42)
     model.fit(X_train, y_train)
     ```

6. **Model Evaluation**
   - Evaluate the model using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score:
     ```python
     y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
     print(classification_report(y_test, y_pred))
     print("Accuracy:", accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred))
     ```

7. **Insights and Recommendations**
   - Based on the predictions, provide actionable insights:
     - Individuals with low sleep hours and high stress levels should aim to improve sleep hygiene.
     - Suggest exercises or activities for those with low physical activity scores.
     - Recommend professional help for individuals with consistently poor mental health scores.

8. **Integration with a Tracker Application (Optional)**
   - Use Flask/Django to deploy the model as a web application.
   - Collect real-time data through user inputs or integrations with fitness trackers.
   - Provide dashboards with mental health trends and personalized recommendations.

#### **Key Insights**
- Stress levels, physical activity, and sleep hours are usually the most influential factors for mental health.
- A robust model can predict mental health status and enable targeted recommendations.
- Encouraging behavioral changes (e.g., better sleep, reduced work hours) can improve mental health outcomes.

### 1. **Data Collection**
   - **Methods**: The static dataset was provided by my internship supervisor. It included various metrics related to mental health and fitness. There were no live data collection processes involved in this project.

### 2. **Data Storage**
   - **Storage Solutions**: The dataset was stored locally in CSV format and accessed directly for processing. No cloud storage or databases were required for this project.

### 3. **Data Processing Lifecycle**
   - **Pipeline Overview**: The data was preprocessed by cleaning it (handling missing values, outliers) and performing feature engineering. Key features included mental health scores, fitness activity levels, and demographic information.
   - **Challenges**: One challenge was dealing with missing values in some of the attributes, which I handled by imputing missing data with mean values.

### 4. **Model Creation**
   - **Model Selection**: I used classification models such as Logistic Regression and Random Forest to predict mental health outcomes based on fitness data. These models were selected based on their ability to handle binary outcomes.
   - **Performance Metrics**: Accuracy and F1-score were used to evaluate model performance. Hyperparameter tuning was performed to optimize the models.

### 5. **Model Deployment**
   - **Deployment Strategy**: As the data was static, there was no need for real-time deployment. However, the model could be integrated into a dashboard or web application for easier access and analysis.
   - **API Creation**: No APIs were created for this project, as it was a static dataset.

### 6. **Storytelling**
   - **Engagement**: I framed the project as a way to help individuals track their fitness and mental health. The project demonstrated how fitness metrics influence mental health and provided actionable insights.
   - **Clarity**: The explanation was simplified to ensure the recruiter understood the model's effectiveness without diving deep into technical jargon.

### 7. **Visualization Tools**
   - **Tools Used**: I used Matplotlib and Seaborn to visualize data trends, including fitness activity vs. mental health scores, to make the results more intuitive.

### 8. **Continuous Learning**
   - **Adaptability**: I gained experience in handling static datasets and learned how to apply machine learning models to non-time-series data. This project enhanced my problem-solving skills and reinforced my learning in classification tasks.
